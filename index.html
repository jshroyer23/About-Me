            I'm a bit of a movie nerd who also loves music and sports. Free time is not a luxury I usually get to enjoy. I have three kids who all are in band. The oldest is also in choir and getting ready to graduate. My middles child plays baseball and tennis. The youngest does gymnastics, volleyball, and theater. Needless to say we are constantly on the run.

            Originally I attended Muscatine Community College and got my AA in Liberal Arts. I then went to the University of Iowa to get a business degree but ended up pursuing a management position at my job a the time. I eventually found my way back to college about thirteen years later and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Computer Science in 2015.

            I have worked in various roles at a wide variety of companies. My first job was a dishwasher and cook at Diamond Dave's Mexican restaurant. From there I went to work making pizzas and becoming a manager at Happy Joe's. I went off to college and started working at Best Buy in Coralville. There I worked my way up to a loss prevention manager and then a sales supervisor. Eventually I took a position as an assistant manager at Blockbuster, which in turn led to being a store manager in Cedar Rapids. Blockbuster closed up shop while I was going back to school and I discovered an internship working for the University of Iowa Radiology Research Department. Upon graduation they hired me on full time. Grant funding ran out for my position and I found myself at GoDaddy. I was doing tech support but realized a developer position wasn't in the cards so moved on. I currently work at Leepfrog Technologies dealing with software for colleges and universities. While working at the hospital and GoDaddy I had a weekend job selling shoes at Scheels.

            My goal is to build on my coding abilities to help up more doors. I would like to find a development job that makes full use of having a CS degree.
